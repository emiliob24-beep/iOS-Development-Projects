## Exercise - Structs, Instances, and Default Values
 
 Imagine you are creating an app that will monitor location. Create a `GPS` struct with two variable properties, `latitude` and `longitude`, both with default values of 0.0.
 */
struct GPS {
    var latitude: Double = 0.0
    var longitude: Double = 0.0
}

//:  Create a variable instance of `GPS` called `somePlace`. It should be initialized without supplying any arguments. Print out the latitude and longitude of `somePlace`, which should be 0.0 for both.
var somePlace = GPS()
print(somePlace)

//:  Change `somePlace`'s latitude to 51.514004, and the longitude to 0.125226, then print the updated values.
//somePlace = GPS(latitude: 0.125226, longitude: 51.514004)
somePlace.latitude = 51.514004
somePlace.longitude = 0.125226
print(somePlace)


//:  Now imagine you are making a social app for sharing your favorite books. Create a `Book` struct with four variable properties: `title`, `author`, `pages`, and `price`. The default values for both `title` and `author` should be an empty string. `pages` should default to 0, and `price` should default to 0.0.
struct Book {
    var title: String = ""
    var author: String = ""
    var pages: Int = 0
    var price: Double = 0.0
}

//:  Create a variable instance of `Book` called `favoriteBook` without supplying any arguments. Print out the title of `favoriteBook`. Does it currently reflect the title of your favorite book? Probably not. Change all four properties of `favoriteBook` to reflect your favorite book. Then, using the properties of `favoriteBook`, print out facts about the book.
var favoriteBook = Book()
 print(favoriteBook)

//favoriteBook = Book(title: "Harry Potter", author: "J.K. Rowling", pages: 784, price: 25)
favoriteBook.title = "Harry Potter"
favoriteBook.author = "J.K. Rowling"
favoriteBook.pages = 784
favoriteBook.price = 25

print("\(favoriteBook.title) is a series of books, 7 of them to be exact. \(favoriteBook.author) is the author of these books. They are a fictional series about a boy growing up without his parents who were killed by his enemy. My favorite book is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows which contains about \(favoriteBook.pages) pages. The hardcover version can go for about \(favoriteBook.price) bucks.")
