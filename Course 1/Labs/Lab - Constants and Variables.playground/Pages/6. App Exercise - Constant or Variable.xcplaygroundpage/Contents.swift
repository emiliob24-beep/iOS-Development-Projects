## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

let userName = "emiliobriceno"
print("I chose user name a constant because the user name will not change")
var age = 23
print("I chose age a variable because we will age and that number will change")
var steps = 2000
print("I chose steps a variable because they will increase throughout the day to reach the goal")
let goalSteps = 10000
print("Goal steps is a constant because that is the number we are trying to reach daily")
var heartRate = 150
print("Heart Rate is a variable because it changes according to our body movement")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
